Fietsmeister was created as a website where cyclists in the Netherlands would have a place to report blocked roads, and thereby help each other create better cycling routes. 
It has been discontinued since Garmin has created a similar feature that is incorperated in their GPS systems.

Created by Tomer Peled for Philip Lobatto and HAS University of Applied Sciences.
